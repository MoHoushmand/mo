```{note} Work in progress
**Work in progress!** <br>
- Welcome to my personal site which is in its infancy and under development. This space serves as a reflection of my interdisciplinary background, diverse skillset, and the projects that have shaped me.
- The vast majority of this site is in English but some minor parts of it is in Norwegian only at the moment for courses I'm tutoring in *Fluid Art* at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/) <br> 
- The rest is a combination of my experience, educations and project in the realm of *Art*, *Applied Behavioral Analysis*, *Quantum Information*, *Data Science* and *Computational Science* with *Applied Mathematics, Mechanics and mostly Numerical Physics* plus some emerging and or established sub fields of *Artificial Intelligence*, better known as *Machine Learning* and *Deep Learning*.
- In my attempt to grasp the fundamentals of *Quantum Computing*, *Quantum Computers* and *Quantum Machine Learning* I have literally been taken thousand of pages of notes, codes and other recourses wher I have worked through tons of exercises. All that will be the heart of what I want to share with the readers in this jupyterbook format that enables flexibility to build a more instructively, interactive and visually appealing book at a later stage to make it easier to grasp for others who want to learn more about these subjects so you don't suffer as much as I did due to the complexity and hardness of it. 
- However, I have to painfully admit that this is not an easy to read or grasp subject, and you will no matter patiently work hard to fascilitate the subjects to be sufficiently matured. To cliche; The more regularly you work through exercises and read other resources the faster and heavier you will comprehend. 
- Any errors, typos or any shape of improvements are more than highly appreciated! <br>

Kind regards

As an ardent advocate for social responsibility, a significant portion of this website is dedicated to my charitable endeavors and unwavering commitment to assisting those in need. I invite you to join me in effecting positive change and empowering others to realize their full potential.

I staunchly believe in the transformative power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of emerging technologies. Here, you will find a showcase of my artwork, emphasizing my passion for the nexus of Art & Science. I invite you to delve into my creative process, from inception to completion, and discover how I've crafted pieces that have significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth, and which I find particularly captivating. Specifically, I will highlight my enthusiasm for Fluid Art, Fluid Mechanics (Turbulence flow), Data Science, Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning, and the Hardware of Quantum Computers.

My fascination lies at the intersection of science and art, turbulence flow, and quantum mechanics, a curiosity that has propelled me on a journey of in-depth exploration. I will share how my fascination for High-Performance materials and High-Performance Computation, particularly Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of Turbulence Flows, led me from the macroscopic certainty of classical physics, where the continuum hypothesis holds, to the microscopic uncertainty of the quantum world. Like any ambitious endeavor, building a Quantum Computer demands profound knowledge and concerted effort, which steered me towards the hardware of Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning. But first, let me recount how the allure of the Navier-Stokes equations and the art of turbulence flow eventually guided me into the quantum domain.

1. I will delve into the artistic aspects of preparing acrylic colors with specific viscosities, ready to blend into unique pieces of Fluid Art
2. I will also discuss the underlying mathematics and associated numerical techniques - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Both these computational techniques in numerical physics are exclusively dedicated to the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, whether solved approximately with CFD or directly with DNS - the holy grail of the governing equations of motion, explicitly dedicated to turbulent flows. DNS is an exceptionally intricate and costly technique, with only a select few worldwide having the privileged resources to simulate it.
3. Quantum Computers, the next generation of computing set to revolutionize our world, are another central focus of mine. I will share my journey into the quantum realm, beginning with the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum information, ultimately leading to the hardware of quantum computers and quantum machine learning.

Feel free to browse, learn, and connect with me as you explore the various facets of my life and work. Whether you're captivated by my artistic creations or intrigued by my technical expertise, I warmly invite you to embark on this journey with me.

**Dedication:** <br>

As an ardent advocate for education and personal growth, I consider myself fortunate to have been guided by some of the most brilliant minds on the planet. I want to dedicate this space to these extraordinary individuals who, above all, set an example of kindness and respect for others, irrespective of their rank or status. Sadly, two of them passed away prematurely in 2017 and 2019.

Firstly, I would like to honor my former professor and greatest inspiration, the exceptional **Hans Petter Langtangen**, who lost his battle with pancreatic cancer in 2017. Astoundingly, he managed to write and finish a series of Springer published bestsellers in Scientific Computing and Engineering between being diagnosed in early 2015 and his untimely passing in the fall of 2017. An extraordinarily inspirational figure, he fostered an environment that encouraged you to perform above and beyond your perceived abilities. He held a firm belief that anyone, regardless of the difficulty of their goals, could succeed with dedication and hard work. A true genius in every sense, he had an unwavering conviction that there were no 'stupid' people and he could convince even the most self-doubting among us that we had the potential to achieve greatness. He was a part of the prestigious Center for Neuroplasticity and his teachings instilled in me a passionate love for Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations. I am immensely proud to have had the opportunity to proofread some of his writings, and to have contributed to his last authored bestseller, Finite Difference Computing with Partial Differential Equations - A Modern Software Approach. I think of him every single day with a mixture of grief and gratitude. Rest in Peace, Maestro!

Secondly, I would like to remember the adventurous and inspiring professor **Peter Wittek** from the University of Toronto, who introduced me to Quantum Machine Learning in 2017. He tragically passed away in the horrific Himalayan avalanche of 2019. I firmly believe that our third attempt to establish a Quantum Computer startup would have been a success if he were still with us. May he rest in peace.

Last but not least, I want to acknowledge my former professor of *Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics* and an immense mentor, **Jon Magne Leinaas**, who, along with Jan Myrheim, discovered Anyons almost 50 years ago. Their discovery was independently confirmed twice in different labs during the pandemic (see for instance Welcome Anyons - Nature). Jon, a member of the Nobel Prize in Physics committee, and Jan have been strong candidates for the prestigious award. The discovery of Anyons, which bridges Fermions with Bosons, has the potential to revolutionize the field of Quantum Computing and could have an unparalleled, positive impact on humanity.

I also want to express my gratitude to Delft University and edx for offering comprehensive, world-class courses in the field of Quantum Computing and Quantum Computer Technology. These resources have played an instrumental role in enabling me to grasp these fascinating yet incredibly complex subjects. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in this field.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments. I am always delighted to connect with others who share my passion for learning, innovation, and positive impact. <br>
