    "Quantum entanglement is a special connection between two qubits. There are many ways to generate entanglement. One way to produce it is by bringing two qubits close together, perform an operation to entangle them and then move them apart again. When they are entangled, you can move them arbitrarily far apart from each other and they will remain entangled. This entanglement will manifest itself in the outcomes of measurements on these qubits. When measured these qubits will always yield zero or one perfectly at random, but no matter how far away they are from each other, they will always yield the same outcome.\n",
    "Entanglement has two very special properties that enable all the applications derived from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first property is that entanglement cannot be shared. If two qubits are maximally entangled with each other, then no other party in the universe can have a share of this entanglement. This property is called the `monogamy` of entanglement.\n",
    "2. The second property of entanglement, which makes it so powerful, is called `maximal coordination`. This property manifests itself when measuring the qubits.\n",
    "When two qubits that are entangled are measured in the same basis, no matter how far away they are from each other, they will always yield the same outcome. This outcome is not decided beforehand, but it is completely random and is decided when the measurement happens.\n",

    "So what is entanglement precisely? Imagine we have 2 particles: we have particle $A$ and particle B. And these particles can be either full, which is the filled have here, empty, or a superposition of the two. Now let’s say that particle A and B are entangled. The weird thing about this entanglement is that when we would measure one of the particles, say we’d like to measure particle A, and we get the outcome/result full. Instantaneously the particle at B collapses into the full state as well. This happens instantaneously, so even faster than the speed of light.\n",
    "However, particle B, or an observer at particle B would never know if Alice, the observer at A has already measured her particle. In order for him to know if Alice measured her particle, Alice needs to send a signal over a classical internet,\n",

Only then they can compare their results and see if their particles were indeed entangled. The particles can also be entangled in a different way. So, this corresponds to when the particle A would be full when we measure it, particle B would be empty, and vice versa: if A would result in empty, B would result in full. If we do not know beforehand which kind of entanglement we have, we can also not know what the state of B will be after measuring A.\n",

    "# Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a method to send qubits using entanglement. Teleportation works as follows: First Alice and Bob need to establish an entangled pair of qubits between them. Alice then takes the qubit that she wants to send and the qubit that is entangled with Bob’s qubit and performs a measurement on them. This measurement collapses the qubits and destroys the entanglement, but gives her two classical outcomes in the form of two classical bits. She takes this two classical bits and sends them over the classical internet to Bob. Bob then applies a correction operation that depends on these two classical bits to his qubit. This allows him to recover the qubit that was originally in Alice’s possession. Note that we have now transmitted a qubit without really using a physical carrier that is capable of transmitting qubits. But of course you already need entanglement to do this. It is also important to note that quantum teleportation does not allow for faster than light communication. This is so because Bob cannot make sense of the qubit in her possession before he gets the classical measurement outcomes from Alice. These classical measurement outcomes must take a certain amount of time to be transmitted. And this time is lower bounded by the speed of light.\n",

    "# Teleportation further explained\n",
    "\n",
    "So we’ve talked a lot about entanglement, but now we will see how we can use this entanglement to teleport a certain quantum state. So let’s take a look at how this works. First, we have two stations: we have station Alice and we have station Bob. Alice and Bob share an entangled state, which means Bob has one qubit of the entangled state and Alice has the other one of the entangled state. What Alice also has is another qubit which is not entangled with any of those which has a state A. Alice and Bob’s goal is to teleport Alice’s state A to Bob’s qubit. The first thing they do is to perform some operations which we again denote as a black box. After the operations have been done, Alice will measure her qubits. Since Alice has 2 qubits the total outcome can be 4 different situations. For example: both the qubits could be measured into the state empty, the first qubit might have been full and the second empty and vice versa. And there is also the situation where both of the qubits are measured to be full. And these four situation also results in 4 different states for Bob. So in the empty-empty case we get the full state A back, but as you can see not all the measurement outcomes result in this nice state A. They do resemble A, but they are rotated or flipped a bit. So Bob needs to do something in order to correctly retrieve the state A. And for this he needs Alice’s help. What does Alice do? Alice uses her information she had on the measured qubits to send Bob instructions. If her first bit was measured to be full, she says to Bob: rotate your qubit 180 degrees clockwise. If it’s empty, do nothing. Almost the same goes for the second qubit, only now the rotation is 90 degrees clockwise. So if it’s full, Bob has to rotate the bit, if it’s empty Bob has to do nothing. So let’s take a look at what this would result in. So let’s take a look at the first case: Alice measured empty-empty. She knows now: I measured empty-empty, and because of my clever operations in the black box I know that Bob must already be in the state A. So I order him to do nothing. She sends Bob this information over a classical internet, so she cannot exceed the speed of light on this one. Then we go to the second possibility, so she measured full on the first qubit and empty on the second qubit. Remember: the instruction on this one was: rotate your qubit 180 degrees clockwise. So let’s take a look. We see we have an A upside down here, and we have to rotate it 180 degrees. And we see that we get the correct state A. So it works for this outcome. But now we take a look at what happened for the third possibility. What is the first qubit was empty and the second qubit was full. This corresponds to a 90 degrees clockwise rotation. So she sends this information to Bob, and Bob says: OK, right, 90 degrees, I can do this! So we see we have this sort of flipped A here, and were going to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, again resulting in the state A. And you can already a little bit check for the final case, when both the qubits are full, we have to rotate 180 degrees clockwise and also rotate 90 degrees clockwise. So this would again result in: first the 180 degrees clockwise... ..and now the 90 degrees clockwise, which is again the state A. So if Bob follows the orders of Alice correctly, and Alice of course sends the correct information, Bob will always retrieve the quantum state A that Alice initially had. So the quantum state has been teleported from Alice’s lab to Bob’s lab.\n",

    "Measurement is the act of observing a quantum state. This observation will yield classical information such as a bit. It is important to note that this measurement process will change the quantum state. For instance if the state is in superposition, this measurement will ‘collapse’ it into a classical state; zero or one. This collapse process happens randomly. Before we do the measurement we have no way of knowing what the outcome will be. What we can do however is to calculate the probability of each outcome. This probability is a prediction about the quantum state, a prediction that we can test by preparing the state many times, measuring it and then counting the fraction of each outcome.\n",

Then, only a spin-up electron can tunnel out of the dot to one of the available states in the reservoir. A spin-down electron will remain trapped inside the quantum dot.\n",
