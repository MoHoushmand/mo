As a professional artist, data scientist, and devoted father, I am driven by a desire to create lasting impact, empower others, and drive transformative technologies. This space serves as a reflection of my interdisciplinary background, diverse skillset, and the projects that have shaped my journey.

Here, you will find a showcase of some of my Artwork, highlighting my love for `Art & Science`. I will share how I approach and finnish off a creative end-to-end work, and discover how I conducted the pieces that have been a significant part of my personal and professional growth that I personally have found captivating. My fascination for the intersection between science and art led me to dig into both the mathematics behind fluid art, *Computational Fluid Dynamics* (`CFD`) with numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations and visualisation by post processing the numerical results, and on how to blend and prepare acrylic colours for execution to create a unique piece of art.

Furthermore delve into the fascinating world of Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Information and the Hardware of Quantum Computers, as I share my insights and knowledge on cutting-edge technologies. Learn about my academic background in Applied Mathematics, Mechanics & Numerical Physics. How I retrained from my Computational Scientist background to Data Scientist as first being introduced to Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing/Understanding/Generation (NLP, NLU, NLG), then Deep Reinforcement Learning and later in 2017 how I stumbled upon Quantum Machine Learning.

My first attempt was in 2013 where I had loosely an idea of combining or utilising graphene as a base for topological qubits. At that time I had not near the competancy required nor a team to establish a QC company. I had convinced one of my IT friends to go for it and my arguments was the worse thing that could happen was that we made the worlds poorest and worse quantum computer with say 3 qubits. At least it was a QC nonetheless. Howeveer my friend got cold feets and backed out when things started to get hot and since Oslo is not Silicon Valley to say at least, I had to throw in the towels myself. I had nothing near the competancy or experience to start even a regular computer hardware company so that was a totally overestimation of my own abilities. But I had a strong drive to do whatever it takes to reach my goals.

My second attempt to establish a Quantum Computer company startup was in 2018. This time there was many morer complicated reasons why I failed to fuse my own composed team with another tech company called iProud which was backed up by xplorico invest and we where about to sign a deal with IBM. At that time I had been in contact with Peter Wittek from the University through emails for a year under the light of his book on Quantum Machine Learning and its potential for data mining. We had loosely discussed some sort of cooperation to implement QML to stand out as a startup. When I was reached out by iProud I was initially intended for a CTO position in an established 18 months health-tech startup where their plan was to create a motivational coach or personal trainer app that through Machine Learning and gamification would get better and better each day by analysing pupilometry and micro-musculatory feedbacks through both smartphone cameras and wearables.

iProud had already made a great distance and the reason they went for was the comibination of having formal competancy, the level of education and experience in Machine Learning and Applied Behavioral Analysis which was mandatory to get that sought after Innovation Norway stamp which would open up the possibilities for EU fundings. In the first meeting with the investors and xplorico I convinced them to go for the quantum world instead as I was convinced that QML would shortly dominate the AI world, and soonly after I was offered a 10% partnership as well in addition to CTO. It was a dream come true situation for me personally as I got free rein to compose and lead my own Data Science and R&D team in Malaysia since xplorico had allready a strong established relation with the Malaysian officials and the Malaysian Oil Fund.

Prior to iProud I had throughout the period between my first attempt and 2018 selectively picked a strong interdisciplinary team to start a company with that and I was sure that the chosen ones had synergies together to build a great and long lasting company. Around that time in spring 2018 I was still waiting for some of my key team members to finnish their PhDs ranging from stem cell engineering to neroscience. Of hinsight I had a too bold and hairy plan that was to build four independent departments in paralell to be merged down the road where the one was a Quantum Computer department, the second was an Artificial Intelligence Lab to later be an Quantum AI lab and the third was a Synthetic Biology lab to evolve into a Quantum Biology lab, and fourth one and maybe the most important one was a fin-tech department that was designed to deploy algorithmic trading with a sufficiently clever strategy with a combination of topic modelling Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), semantic twitter analysis, technical and fundemental analysis. The Idea was to hopefully be self contained in the near and far future and to be able to fund our own research and development.

The problem arose when iProud wanted me to sign a NDA or Non Desclosure agreement which I had to consult with my own team where they unanimously voted me to refuse signing as it was too rigid where all my ideas was to be owned by iProud dor the next 5 years, and I was not allowed to work on any other projects or involve any others in any shape. However lucrative deal it was for me that was under extreme pressure from my ex girlfriends lawyers to pay out for her share of our appartment and my family. I had to be true to my own team and don't let them down by signing that deal so I had to refuse with a heavy heart.

My third attempt to establish the first Quantum Computer Company in Norway came a year later in 2019. And his time my team was ready although some of them still was working on their PhDs. This time was really surreal situation where I was backed up by a dream team full of talented superstars and top of the field people that I was so fortunate to have on board. But we failed badly due to partly because of friction between the business department and academic and technical department. But mostly because my own lack of experience as a CEO that I did not wanted to be in the first place because of all that administrative work that followed tha I was not interested in at all.

The CEO position was elected by the board and I had no choice to reject because it was a decleration of trust but however uncomfertable I was I needed to do my best until we found an appropriate CEO. I thought I was a much more competent leader than I was. Surely I had the ability to motivate my surroundings there much more into a CEO role than that. I failed to delegate appropriate work to the right labour and to communicate with the board, the investors and most devestatingly I was a too nice guy to handle employee conflicts where I was too passive and less proactive. Sure it was a steap learning curve and valuable experience but a costly and hurtful one.

We finally found my succesor, our dear friend from the University of Toronto Peter Wittek. He could assist us from being temporarily CEO, and he agreed to help us navigate in the jungle of investors, finding right labour, linking us with the right people and all that. A personal reliefe that I was becoming overloaded and burned out, and finally I would get back to the "floor" working in R&D department with Quantum Computing and Computer development. Unfortunately he tragically got caught by the  Himalaya 2019 fall avalanch. Probably the thoughest time of my life while waiting for the confirmation and news of his faith, as I until this day still am not sure if there was any attempts at all to find the group that dissapeared. It was a overly devestating hard time for not only his family and friends, but the small community as a whole since he was pioneering figure in the Quantum Machine Learning community. In any case while waiting for official announcements I was in a state of shock and disbelief and I was not able to work for a long time. Then the pandemic hit us in the spring of 2020 and that was it! The investors held back, broke in any shape and form, the company was dissolved, and I was left with a broken heart and a broken dream.

```{admonition} Explanation
Explanation We can think of the repeater protocol as being divided into two smaller protocols. First, Alice and the repeater generate shared entanglement. Then, Bob and the repeater generate shared entanglement, which they use to teleport half of the Alice/repeater entangled state to Bob

- [ ] It is not possible to read out a superposition of spin states.
- [ ] Three quantum dots are required to perform this readout protocol.
- [ ] Magnetic noise can prevent the spin-up electron to tunnel out, since the Lorentz force accelerates the electron perpendicular to the direction of motion.
- [x] A spin-down electron can acquire the energy necessary to tunnel out of the dot from thermal fluctuations.
