## Interdisciplinary collaboration

```{epigraph}
Collaboration is the stuff of growth.

-- Sir Ken Robinson
```

I strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of emerging technologies. As an Artist, Applied Mathematician, Physicist, and Data Scientist, my endeavors span a wide spectrum. I have a profound interest in the interplay between Art and Science and am captivated by the convergence of diverse disciplines within these domains. This website not only showcases my artwork but also highlights my analytical projects, exemplifying my domain knowledge in Fluid Art, Fluid Mechanics, Turbulence Flow, Data Science, Computational Science, Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning, and the Hardware of Quantum Computers.

The artistic aspects of preparing acrylic colors with specific viscosities, ready to blend into unique pieces of Fluid Art, is currently in Norwegian for courses I'm tutoring in Fluid Art at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/). However, an English version is in the works. The dedicated scientific aspects of the fluid mechanics of these acrylic colors and their interactions, both with each other and the canvas from a mathematical perspective, are available exclusively in English. While the former is more visual, the latter is technically demanding. Without the appropriate background in applied mathematics, mechanics, and numerical physics, you might find it challenging. Yet, I encourage readers to engage with the content, starting from the basics and working their way up to the governing equations.

My fascination lies at the intersection of science and art, turbulence flow, and quantum mechanics, a curiosity that has propelled me on a journey of in-depth exploration. I will share how my fascination for High-Performance materials and High-Performance Computation, particularly Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of Turbulence Flows, led me from the macroscopic certainty of classical physics, where the continuum hypothesis holds, to the microscopic uncertainty of the quantum world. Like any ambitious endeavor, building a Quantum Computer demands profound knowledge and concerted effort, which steered me towards the hardware of Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning. But first, let me recount how the allure of the Navier-Stokes equations and the art of turbulence flow eventually guided me into the quantum domain.

The underlying mathematics and associated numerical technique is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), with the latter being especially intricate and resource-intensive. Both these computational techniques in numerical physics are dedicated to the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, explicitly addressing turbulent flows. DNS is an exceptionally intricate and costly technique, with only a select few worldwide having the privileged resources to simulate it.

Quantum Computers, poised to revolutionize our technological landscape, form another central focus of my work. I will share my extensive journey into the quantum realm, from the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum information, to the engineering of quantum computer hardware, delving into Quantum Machine Learning, and culminating with Topological Quantum Computers (TQC) and Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). My discussions will also emphasize the mathematical foundations of quantum computing, including linear algebra, quantum gates, quantum circuits, and material science, detailing how they are assembled and implemented in quantum hardware.

My journey into Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers, and Quantum Machine Learning has allowed me to amass a trove of notes, codes, and invaluable resources. I've curated these materials to present them in an interactive JupyterBook format. Designed for clarity and interactivity, this platform serves as a gateway to the intricate world of quantum technologies.

Hence, a significant portion of my portefolio is devoted to Quantum Machine Learning and Topological Quantum Computers, especially the innovative potential of Anyons in fault-tolerant quantum computation. I am convinced that these Anyon-based systems will pioneer the next phase in quantum technology. Through my explorations, I aspire to make substantial contributions to the global understanding and utilization of this groundbreaking tech.

Tackling these advanced subjects can be intimidating, and I've navigated their challenges firsthand. My mission is to guide you through, reducing the hurdles that I once faced. By engaging actively — through exercises, visualization, and mnemonic techniques — I believe you can achieve a deep understanding of these topics. However, mastering these intricate subjects requires both patience and dedication. Your consistent engagement with the materials will illuminate the concepts, making them clearer with time.

Your insights and feedback on any part of this website, be it for corrections or enhancements, are invaluable to me.

```{admonition} Work in progress

- This site is in its infancy and under development, mostly in English but some minor parts of it is in Norwegian at the moment for courses tutoring in **Fluid Art** at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/) <br> 
- The rest is a combination of experience, educations and project in the realm Art, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Data Science and Computational with Applied Mathematics, Mechanics, Numerical Phuysics and some sub fields of Artificial Intelligence. 
- In my attempt to grasp the fundamentals of Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning I have literally been taken thousand of pages of notes, codes and other recourses wher I have worked through tons of exercises. All that will be the heart of what I want to share with the readers in this jupyterbook format that enables flexibility to build a more instructively, interactive and visually appealing book at a later stage to make it easier to grasp for others who want to learn more about these subjects so you don't suffer as much as I did due to the complexity and hardness of it. 
- However, I also have to painfully admit that this is not an easy to read or grasp subject, and you will no matter patiently work hard to fascilitate the subjects to be sufficiently matured. To cliche; The more regularly you work through exercises, read other resources, visualize, mindmap, mnnomics and use all your senses to try understand comprehend, your imagination the faster and heavier you will comprehend. 
- in Norwegian that is in the process of being translated to English.
Any errors, typos or any shape of improvements are more than highly appreciated! <br>

Kind regards

### Hans Petter Langtangen (1962-2017)

I am a passionate supporter of education and personal growth I consider myself far too fortunate to have been guided by some of the most brilliant minds on the planet. I want to dedicate this space to these extraordinary individuals who, above all, set an example of kindness and respect for others, irrespective of their rank or status guided me to the topics that occupies most of my time and the vast majority of this space. Tragically, two of them passed away prematurely in 2017 and 2019.
First, I would like to honor my former professor and greatest inspiration, the exceptional awardwinning world reknowned proffessor, educator, vissionary and game changer [**Hans Petter Langtangen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Petter_Langtangen), who lost his battle with pancreatic cancer in 2017. Astoundingly, he managed to write and finish a series of Springer published bestsellers in Scientific Computing and Engineering between being diagnosed in early 2015 and his untimely passing in the fall of 2017. An extraordinarily inspirational figure, he fostered an environment that encouraged you to perform above and beyond your perceived abilities. He held a firm belief that anyone, regardless of the difficulty of their goals, could succeed with dedication and hard work. A true genius in every sense, he had an unwavering conviction that there were no 'stupid' people and he could convince even the most self-doubting among us that we had the potential to achieve greatness. He was a part of the prestigious Center for Neuroplasticity and his teachings instilled in me a passionate love for Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations. I am immensely proud to have had the opportunity to proofread some of his writings, and to have contributed to his last authored bestseller, Finite Difference Computing with Partial Differential Equations - A Modern Software Approach. I think of him every single day with a mixture of grief and gratitude. Rest in Peace, Maestro!

---

### Peter Wittek (1980-2019)

Secondly, I wish to honor the memory of the adventurous and inspiring professor, [**Peter Wittek**](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-s-peter-wittek-who-will-be-remembered-feb-3-event-why-future-quantum) from the University of Toronto. He introduced me to Quantum Machine Learning back in 2017, when I had only just begun my earnest exploration of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Topic Modelling, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). At the time, I was an intern working as a Data Scientist in what was then the first officially funded AI Lab in Norway. Despite my novice status, I found Professor Wittek's teachings invaluable, due in large part to my background in physics which provided a foundation to grasp these complex concepts with considerable effort.

Unfortunately, Professor Wittek's life was tragically cut short in the devastating Himalayan avalanche of 2019. To this day, I carry a firm belief that had he still been with us, our third attempt to establish a Quantum Computing startup would have seen great success. His untimely demise is a profound loss to the scientific community and to everyone who had the privilege of knowing him personally or professionally. I shall always remember him, not just for his ground-breaking work in Quantum Machine Learning, but for his generosity in guiding me to navigate in this at that time completeley new emerging field during my early steps in the field, and later having faith in me and our maybe of hindsight overly ambitious attempt to pioneer the first Quantum Computer Company in Norway. May he rest in peace.

### Jon Magne Leinaas

I am priviliged to be able to acknowledge and salute my former professor in *Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics* (Moderne Quantum Mechanics). What a giant of a mentor and more importantly the very best example of homo sapiens [**Jon Magne Leinaas**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Magne_Leinaas) who, alongside with his buddy **Jan Myrheim** discovered **`Anyons`** for almost 50 years ago. Their discovery was independently confirmed twice in different labs during the pandemic (see for instance Welcome Anyons - Nature). Jon, a member of the Nobel Prize in Physics committee, and Jan have been strong candidates for the prestigious award. The discovery of Anyons, which bridges Fermions with Bosons, has the potential to revolutionize the field of Quantum Computing and could have an unparalleled, positive impact on humanity.

Upon covering the diverse array of qubit types, my attention will significantly shift towards Topological Quantum Computers. It is my intention to devote a considerable portion of my future work in this direction, to elucidate every facet of the groundbreaking discovery of Anyons - a new class of particles, represent a profound advancement in our understanding of quantum mechanics. They form the underlying theoretical basis for Topological Quantum Computers, a novel computing paradigm that leverages the unique properties of so called exotic quasi particles Anyons for computational tasks. As such, they embody a promising approach to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation, which is one of the most significant challenges in the field.

I am strongly convinced that Topological Quantum Computers, powered by Anyon-based qubits, will lead the next wave of advancements in quantum computing. My conviction is based on their inherent fault tolerance and stability, characteristics that are quintessential for the operation of practical, large-scale quantum computers. Through this dedicated exploration, I aim to highlight the profound potential of Anyon-based Topological Quantum Computers and their potential to dominate the future of quantum computing. This exploration will not only pay homage to the remarkable work of Leinaas but also contribute to advancing our collective understanding of this promising technology. I sincerely believe that by shedding light on the intricacies of these systems, we can inspire and accelerate further research and development in this space, ultimately bringing us closer to the quantum future we all envision.

Finally I also want to express my gratitude to Delft University and edx for offering comprehensive, world-class courses in the field of Quantum Computing and Quantum Computer Technology. These resources have played an instrumental role in enabling me to grasp these fascinating yet incredibly complex subjects and this site is highly influenced from the courses they have offered. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in this field.

I hope you enjoy exploring this website and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments. Feel free to browse, learn, and connect with me as you explore the various facets of my life and work. Whether you're captivated by my artistic creations or intrigued by my technical expertise, I warmly invite you to embark on this journey with me and I am always delighted to connect with others who share my passion for learning, innovation, and positive impact. <br>

> Sincerely Yours
>

Welcome to my personal website & digital portfolio.

## Background

I'm an artist at heart, with a diverse background in Applied Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, and Entrepreneurship. My journey began in art, evolving to appreciate the synergy between art and science, especially in Fluid Art and Fluid Mechanics.

I hold an MSc in Applied Mathematics, Mechanics & Numerical Physics from the University of Oslo (UiO), a BSc in Civil Engineering from Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences (HiOA), and a BA in Design & Modelling Techniques from ESMOD Bordeaux/Oslo. Additionally, I've earned certifications in Mathematics for Machine Learning, Quantum Machine Learning, and Quantum Computer Hardware from top universities.

## Achievements

I had the privilege of proofreading for Professor Hans Petter Langtangen, notably his bestseller: "Finite Difference Computing with Partial Differential Equations - A Modern Software Approach".

In 2017, I joined as one of the first Data Scientists at the AI Lab funded by the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). My tenure at NAV was transformative, where I developed tools like 'Zipminator' for secure data handling and worked on various data science projects. In 2022, I rejoined NAV, further enhancing my skills in data handling, infrastructure design, and full-stack development.

Entrepreneurial Ventures

Between 2017-2021, I delved into quantum technologies. Initially, as the CTO of iProud, backed by Xplorico and Malaysian officials, we aimed to create a personal coach using hybrid machine learning algorithms. Later, as the CEO of QDaria, Norway's first Quantum Computer Company, our vision was to build a quantum computer to tackle complex global problems. QDaria comprised four departments: Quantum Computer Hardware Engineering, Quantum AI Lab, Synthetic Biology lab, and a Q-Investment Hub.

Our ultimate goal was to impact the health tech sector, focusing on bioinformatics, disease diagnosis, prediction, and drug discovery using ML, QML, and Quantum Computer Hardware.

About This Website

Here, I share notes, codes, and resources in an interactive jupyterbook format, demystifying quantum subjects. Topics range from quantum mechanics basics to the potential of Anyons in quantum computation. I also discuss Turbulence Flows and the Navier-Stokes equations.

I invite you to explore and provide feedback. Dive into the intersection of art and science, and I hope you find both inspiration and knowledge.

Additionally, I've earned certifications in Mathematics for Machine Learning, Quantum Machine Learning, and Quantum Computer Hardware from top universities.

## Achievements

I had the privilege of proofreading for Professor Hans Petter Langtangen, notably his bestseller: "Finite Difference Computing with Partial Differential Equations - A Modern Software Approach".

In 2017, I joined as one of the first Data Scientists at the AI Lab funded by the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). My tenure at NAV was transformative, where I developed tools like 'Zipminator' for secure data handling and worked on various data science projects. In 2022, I rejoined NAV, further enhancing my skills in data handling, infrastructure design, and full-stack development.

Entrepreneurial Ventures

Between 2017-2021, I delved into quantum technologies. Initially, as the CTO of iProud, backed by Xplorico and Malaysian officials, we aimed to create a personal coach using hybrid machine learning algorithms. Later, as the CEO of QDaria, Norway's first Quantum Computer Company, our vision was to build a quantum computer to tackle complex global problems. QDaria comprised four departments: Quantum Computer Hardware Engineering, Quantum AI Lab, Synthetic Biology lab, and a Q-Investment Hub.

Our ultimate goal was to impact the health tech sector, focusing on bioinformatics, disease diagnosis, prediction, and drug discovery using ML, QML, and Quantum Computer Hardware.

## Interdisciplinary collaboration

```{epigraph}
Collaboration is the stuff of growth.

-- Sir Ken Robinson
```

I strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of emerging technologies. As an Artist, Applied Mathematician, Physicist, and Data Scientist, my endeavors span a wide spectrum. I have a profound interest in the interplay between Art and Science and am captivated by the convergence of diverse disciplines within these domains. This website not only showcases my artwork but also highlights my analytical projects, exemplifying my domain knowledge in Fluid Art, Fluid Mechanics, Turbulence Flow, Data Science, Computational Science, Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning, and the Hardware of Quantum Computers.

The artistic aspects of preparing acrylic colors with specific viscosities, ready to blend into unique pieces of Fluid Art, is currently in Norwegian for courses I'm tutoring in Fluid Art at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/). However, an English version is in the works. The dedicated scientific aspects of the fluid mechanics of these acrylic colors and their interactions, both with each other and the canvas from a mathematical perspective, are available exclusively in English. While the former is more visual, the latter is technically demanding. Without the appropriate background in applied mathematics, mechanics, and numerical physics, you might find it challenging. Yet, I encourage readers to engage with the content, starting from the basics and working their way up to the governing equations.

My fascination lies at the intersection of science and art, turbulence flow, and quantum mechanics, a curiosity that has propelled me on a journey of in-depth exploration. I will share how my fascination for High-Performance materials and High-Performance Computation, particularly Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of Turbulence Flows, led me from the macroscopic certainty of classical physics, where the continuum hypothesis holds, to the microscopic uncertainty of the quantum world. Like any ambitious endeavor, building a Quantum Computer demands profound knowledge and concerted effort, which steered me towards the hardware of Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning. But first, let me recount how the allure of the Navier-Stokes equations and the art of turbulence flow eventually guided me into the quantum domain.

The underlying mathematics and associated numerical technique is Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), with the latter being especially intricate and resource-intensive. Both these computational techniques in numerical physics are dedicated to the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, explicitly addressing turbulent flows. DNS is an exceptionally intricate and costly technique, with only a select few worldwide having the privileged resources to simulate it.

Quantum Computers, poised to revolutionize our technological landscape, form another central focus of my work. I will share my extensive journey into the quantum realm, from the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum information, to the engineering of quantum computer hardware, delving into Quantum Machine Learning, and culminating with Topological Quantum Computers (TQC) and Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). My discussions will also emphasize the mathematical foundations of quantum computing, including linear algebra, quantum gates, quantum circuits, and material science, detailing how they are assembled and implemented in quantum hardware.

My journey into Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers, and Quantum Machine Learning has allowed me to amass a trove of notes, codes, and invaluable resources. I've curated these materials to present them in an interactive JupyterBook format. Designed for clarity and interactivity, this platform serves as a gateway to the intricate world of quantum technologies.

Hence, a significant portion of my portefolio is devoted to Quantum Machine Learning and Topological Quantum Computers, especially the innovative potential of Anyons in fault-tolerant quantum computation. I am convinced that these Anyon-based systems will pioneer the next phase in quantum technology. Through my explorations, I aspire to make substantial contributions to the global understanding and utilization of this groundbreaking tech.

Tackling these advanced subjects can be intimidating, and I've navigated their challenges firsthand. My mission is to guide you through, reducing the hurdles that I once faced. By engaging actively — through exercises, visualization, and mnemonic techniques — I believe you can achieve a deep understanding of these topics. However, mastering these intricate subjects requires both patience and dedication. Your consistent engagement with the materials will illuminate the concepts, making them clearer with time.

Your insights and feedback on any part of this website, be it for corrections or enhancements, are invaluable to me.

```{admonition} Work in progress

- This site is in its infancy and under development, mostly in English but some minor parts of it is in Norwegian at the moment for courses tutoring in **Fluid Art** at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/) <br> 
- The rest is a combination of experience, educations and project in the realm Art, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Data Science and Computational with Applied Mathematics, Mechanics, Numerical Phuysics and some sub fields of Artificial Intelligence. 
- In my attempt to grasp the fundamentals of Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning I have literally been taken thousand of pages of notes, codes and other recourses wher I have worked through tons of exercises. All that will be the heart of what I want to share with the readers in this jupyterbook format that enables flexibility to build a more instructively, interactive and visually appealing book at a later stage to make it easier to grasp for others who want to learn more about these subjects so you don't suffer as much as I did due to the complexity and hardness of it. 
- However, I also have to painfully admit that this is not an easy to read or grasp subject, and you will no matter patiently work hard to fascilitate the subjects to be sufficiently matured. To cliche; The more regularly you work through exercises, read other resources, visualize, mindmap, mnnomics and use all your senses to try understand comprehend, your imagination the faster and heavier you will comprehend. 
- in Norwegian that is in the process of being translated to English.
Any errors, typos or any shape of improvements are more than highly appreciated! <br>

Kind regards
