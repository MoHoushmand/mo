```{admonition} Explanation
Explanation We can think of the repeater protocol as being divided into two smaller protocols. First, Alice and the repeater generate shared entanglement. Then, Bob and the repeater generate shared entanglement, which they use to teleport half of the Alice/repeater entangled state to Bob

- [ ] It is not possible to read out a superposition of spin states.
- [ ] Three quantum dots are required to perform this readout protocol.
- [ ] Magnetic noise can prevent the spin-up electron to tunnel out, since the Lorentz force accelerates the electron perpendicular to the direction of motion.
- [x] A spin-down electron can acquire the energy necessary to tunnel out of the dot from thermal fluctuations.

```{admination} Work in progress
- This site is in its infancy and under development, mostly in English but some minor parts of it is in Norwegian at the moment for courses tutoring in **Fluid Art** at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/) <br> 
- The rest is a combination of experience, educations and project in the realm Art, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Data Science and Computational with Applied Mathematics, Mechanics, Numerical Phuysics and some sub fields of Artificial Intelligence. 
- In my attempt to grasp the fundamentals of Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning I have literally been taken thousand of pages of notes, codes and other recourses wher I have worked through tons of exercises. All that will be the heart of what I want to share with the readers in this jupyterbook format that enables flexibility to build a more instructively, interactive and visually appealing book at a later stage to make it easier to grasp for others who want to learn more about these subjects so you don't suffer as much as I did due to the complexity and hardness of it. 
- However, I also have to painfully admit that this is not an easy to read or grasp subject, and you will no matter patiently work hard to fascilitate the subjects to be sufficiently matured. To cliche; The more regularly you work through exercises, read other resources, visualize, mindmap, mnnomics and use all your senses to try understand comprehend, your imagination the faster and heavier you will comprehend. 
- in Norwegian that is in the process of being translated to English.
Any errors, typos or any shape of improvements are more than highly appreciated! <br>

Kind regards

:class: tip

- This website is currently in its very early infancy stages of development, primarily written in English. However, some sections are currently in Norwegian, specifically for courses on **Fluid Art** at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/). 
- The content herein is a blend of passions, experiences, education, and projects spanning various fields including Art, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Data Science, and Computational Mathematics with Applied Mechanics, Numerical Physics, and several subdomains of Artificial Intelligence. 
- As part of my journey to understand Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers, and Quantum Machine Learning, I have dedicated countless hours taking extensive notes, writing code, and working through myriad exercises. The resulting body of knowledge forms the core of what I intend to share with you, the reader. This information is presented in a Jupyterbook format to facilitate an instructive, interactive, and visually engaging learning experience.
- I must concede that these subjects are complex and can be challenging to comprehend. It requires dedicated and regular practice to facilitate sufficient understanding. To phrase it clich√©; the more regularly you engage with exercises, read additional resources, employ visualization techniques, mind maps, mnemonics, and harness all your senses to understand and imagine, the more rapidly and robustly you will comprehend these subjects.
- There are sections in Norwegian currently being translated into English. I warmly welcome any feedback, whether it's pointing out errors, typos, or suggesting improvements of any kind. 

With Kind Regards,

s a firm believer in social responsibility, a portion of this website will dedicate to my charity work and ongoing commitment to helping those in need. Join me in my efforts to create positive change and empower others to reach their full potential.

I am also a strong believer in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of emerging technologies to create positive changes. Here, you will find a showcase of some of my Artwork, highlighting my love for `Art & Science`. How I approach, start and finnish off a creative processes end-to-end, and discover how I made some of the pieces that have been a significant part of my personal and professional growth, and that I personally have found captivating. <br>

Especially I will emphesise my passion for Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning and the Hardware of Quantum Computers.

Fascinated by the intersection between science and art, turbulence flow and quantum mechanics, led me into deep trouble by digging into both. In the following I will share how I got drawn into the world of Quantum Computers, from fascination of High Performance materials and High Performance Computation, that eventually led me into the quantum world and ambitiously hairy obsessed to build a quantum cmputers. With like any other subjects, building a Quantum Computer requires solid knowledge and extreme efforts which eventually led me into the Hardware of Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning. But first how I was mesmerized by the beauty of the Navier-Stokes equations and the art of turbulence flow that later on led me into the quantum world.

1. The artistic part of it in how to prepare acrylic colours with certain viscosities preparing them ready to blend into unique pieces of art.
2. Secondly the mathematics behind, and the accociated numerical techniques - *Computational Fluid Dynamics* (`CFD`) and *Direct Numerical Simulation* (`DNS`),

Both computational techniques in numerical physics exclusively dedicated to soutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, either solving them approximately with CFD or directly with DNS - the holy grail of the governing equations of motions explicitly dedicated to turbulens flows and an extremely reserved and even more expensive technique that only a few in the world have had the resources to simulate).

Feel free to browse, learn, and connect with me as you explore the various facets of my life and work. Whether you are drawn to my artistic creations or intrigued by my technical expertise, I invite you to share in my journey and passion for learning, innovation, and positive impact.
As an ardent believer in social responsibility, a significant portion of this website is dedicated to my charitable work and ongoing commitment to assist those in need. I invite you to join me in my efforts to effect positive change and empower others to reach their full potential.

I hold a strong conviction in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of emerging technologies to instigate positive transformations. Here, you will find a showcase of my artwork, emphasizing my passion for the intersection of Art & Science. I invite you to explore my creative process from inception to completion, and discover how I created pieces that have been instrumental in my personal and professional growth, and which I find especially captivating. Particularly, I will emphasize my enthusiasm for Art (FLuid Art), Fluid Mechanics (Turbulence flow), Data Science, Quantum Computing, Quantum Machine Learning, and the Hardware of Quantum Computers.

I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of science and art, turbulence flow and quantum mechanics, a curiosity that has led me on a journey of extensive exploration. I will share how I was drawn into the realm of Quantum Computers, starting with my fascination for High-Performance materials and High-Performance Computation with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Simulations of Turbulence Flows from macroscopic certainty to where classical physics breaks with continuum hypothesis to microscopic uncertainty and the quantum world. Like any ambitious endeavor, building a Quantum Computer requires solid knowledge and extreme effort, which eventually led me into the hardware of Quantum Computers and Quantum Machine Learning. But first, let me share how I was captivated by the beauty of the Navier-Stokes equations and the art of turbulence flow, which later guided me into the quantum domain.

1. I will delve into the artistic aspects of preparing acrylic colors with specific viscosities, ready to blend into unique pieces of art.
2. I will also discuss the underlying mathematics and associated numerical techniques - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Both these computational techniques in numerical physics are exclusively dedicated to the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. They either solve them approximately with CFD or directly with DNS - the holy grail of the governing equations of motion explicitly dedicated to turbulent flows. DNS is an exceptionally intricate and expensive technique, with only a handful of people worldwide having the priviliged resources to simulate it.
3. Quantum Computers are the next generation of computers that will revolutionize the world as we know it. I will share my journey into the quantum realm, starting with the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum information, and eventually leading to the hardware of quantum computers and quantum machine learning.

Feel free to browse, learn, and connect with me as you explore the various facets of my life and work. Whether you're captivated by my artistic creations or intrigued by my technical expertise, I warmly invite you to embark on this journey with me

```{note} Work in progress
**Work in progress!** <br>
- Welcome to my personal site which is in its infancy and under development. This space serves as a reflection of my interdisciplinary background, diverse skillset, and the projects that have shaped me.
- The vast majority of this site is in English but some minor parts of it is in Norwegian only at the moment for courses I'm tutoring in *Fluid Art* at [tegenskole.no](http://www.tegneskole.no/) <br> 
- The rest is a combination of my experience, educations and project in the realm of *Art*, *Applied Behavioral Analysis*, *Quantum Information*, *Data Science* and *Computational Science* with *Applied Mathematics, Mechanics and mostly Numerical Physics* plus some emerging and or established sub fields of *Artificial Intelligence*, better known as *Machine Learning* and *Deep Learning*.
- In my attempt to grasp the fundamentals of *Quantum Computing*, *Quantum Computers* and *Quantum Machine Learning* I have literally been taken thousand of pages of notes, codes and other recourses wher I have worked through tons of exercises. All that will be the heart of what I want to share with the readers in this jupyterbook format that enables flexibility to build a more instructively, interactive and visually appealing book at a later stage to make it easier to grasp for others who want to learn more about these subjects so you don't suffer as much as I did due to the complexity and hardness of it. 
- However, I have to painfully admit that this is not an easy to read or grasp subject, and you will no matter patiently work hard to fascilitate the subjects to be sufficiently matured. To cliche; The more regularly you work through exercises and read other resources the faster and heavier you will comprehend. 
- Any errors, typos or any shape of improvements are more than highly appreciated! <br>

Kind regards

```{admonition} In Progress..
**Site under development** <br> 

Welcome to my personal digital space, reflecting my unique blend of experiences, disciplines, skills, and transformational projects that have shaped my journey.

- The majority of the content here is in English, although you may encounter some sections in Norwegian, predominantly catering to the courses I conduct in Fluid Art at tegenskole.no
This platform amalgamates my experiences, education, and projects in a wide range of fields like Art, Applied Behavioral Analysis, Quantum Information, Data Science, and Computational Science, with a concentration on Applied Mathematics, Mechanics, and Numerical Physics. Additionally, you will discover material on emerging and well-established subdomains of Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), encompassing ..Generation (NLG), ..Understanding (NLU), Deep Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML).
Throughout my quest to understand Quantum Computing, Quantum Computers, and Quantum Machine Learning, I've created thousands of pages of notes, codes, and a myriad of resources, diligently working through countless exercises. This constitutes the core of what I desire to share with readers via this interactive JupyterBook format. My aim is to present these mentally invigorating yet challenging topics in a visually engaging and simplified manner to facilitate your learning journey.
I understand and acknowledge the complexity and demands of these subjects. I've strived to deconstruct every intricate topic into more digestible components for better understanding. However, these fields require perseverance and patience to fully grasp. I assure you, with regular practice and exploration of resources, your comprehension will deepen and speed up.
Feedback is crucial for continuous improvement, so if you detect any errors, typos, or identify opportunities for enhancement, please feel free to share!"
