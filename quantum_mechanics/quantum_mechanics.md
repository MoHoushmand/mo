# Quantum Mechanics

Usually, lectures, articles and videos about quantum computation mostly talk about qubits themselves, and all the quantum phenomena that make qubits exciting, futuristic, and almost impossible to fully understand.
Qubits on their own, however, don’t form a working quantum computer. The qubit might be the most spectacular element of the computer, but many more layers are needed to actually work with the quantum phenomena that give the quantum computer its great powers.

In the following we will touch on all of these layers: from the devices which bridge the gap between the quantum chip and the classical control hardware, to the mathematical aspects of some quantum algorithms. This interactive book will be divided in four parts different qubits and operations on these qubits. Architecture, Algorithms, and Protocols of a Quantum Computer and Quantum Internet

How all the building blocks of a quantum computer work, and deeper information on the qubits which lie at the heart of a quantum computer and internet. How qubits can be used and controlled efficiently, and the workings of the four most promising types of solid-state qubits: **Silicon Spin Qubit**, **Diamond NV Center Qubit**, **Superconducting Transmon Qubit** and **Topological Qubit**. Get the most out of this course! This course aims to give you an understanding of the scientific basis behind the quantum computer and a quantum internet; and of four different qubits. Our challenge to you is to really understand the
working principles of qubits and, at the same time, the working principles of a computer made of these qubits.
This course is about getting an insight in the four different types of qubits, the essential element at the heart of a quantum computer and a quantum inter- net. We will inspire each other and we ask that you bring in your experiences, your insights and your thoughts via the forums. So the key message is: don’t be afraid to share.

```{admonition} Explanation
Explanation We can think of the repeater protocol as being divided into two smaller protocols. First, Alice and the repeater generate shared entanglement. Then, Bob and the repeater generate shared entanglement, which they use to teleport half of the Alice/repeater entangled state to Bob

- [ ] It is not possible to read out a superposition of spin states.
- [ ] Three quantum dots are required to perform this readout protocol.
- [ ] Magnetic noise can prevent the spin-up electron to tunnel out, since the Lorentz force accelerates the electron perpendicular to the direction of motion.
- [x] A spin-down electron can acquire the energy necessary to tunnel out of the dot from thermal fluctuations.
